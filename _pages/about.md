I am an MSc Computing (AI/ML) student at the [Dept. of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing). Previously, I completed my Bachelors at the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at [Jadavpur University (JU)](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in). I am presently remotely working as a part of [UbiLab](https://uwaterloo.ca/ubiquitous-health-technology-lab/) as a Technical Consultant (earlier as [MITACS Globalink Research Intern](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship)) at the [University of Wateloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) to develop a rich data ecosystem capable of mining and hosting air quality data from consumer-level air quality monitors installed in [Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulaanbaatar).

As an [IASc-INSA-NASI](https://www.ias.ac.in/) Summer Research Fellow, I have previously worked on formal verification of [ACAS Xu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9081758) like neural networks at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ansuman Bannerjee](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=rGFo1TQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research interests lie in the broad spectrum of ["AI for Social Good"](https://ai.google/social-good/) where we leverage the recent advancements made within [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) to engineer real-world systems so as to ensure maximum social impact. During my undergraduate days at [JU](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in), I extensively worked with [Dr. Sarbani Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vembv2sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) to develop novel AI based approaches in order to re-think ways of doing predictive analytics on air pollution levels of different cities in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India).

In addition to my research activities, I actively volunteered as the Class Representative as well as the Placement Coordinator of the BCSE'22 batch at [JU](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in). In recognition of my efforts as a student member of the [IEEE Student Activities Committee](https://students.ieee.org/), I was elected as the Chairperson of the [Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/) Chapter of the [IEEE JU Student Branch](https://ieee-jaduniv.in/) and also bestowed the honour of being a proud recipient of the [Richard E. Merwin Student Scholarship](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/scholarships/merwin) by [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/).

I am an avid quizzer since high school. During my free time, I actively participate in trivia hunts where I scour the internet together to mine interesting facts regarding various topics.
